class WaterbalanceFD(SimulationObject):
    """Waterbalance for freely draining soils under water-limited production.

    The purpose of the soil water balance calculations is to estimate the
    daily value of the soil moisture content. The soil moisture content
    influences soil moisture uptake and crop transpiration.
    
    The dynamic calculations are carried out in two sections, one for the 
    calculation of rates of change per timestep (= 1 day) and one for the
    calculation of summation variables and state variables. The water balance
    is driven by rainfall, possibly buffered as surface storage, and
    evapotranspiration. The processes considered are infiltration, soil water
    retention, percolation (here conceived as downward water flow from rooted
    zone to second layer), and the loss of water beyond the maximum root zone. 

    The textural profile of the soil is conceived as homogeneous. Initially the
    soil profile consists of two layers, the actually rooted soil and the soil
    immediately below the rooted zone until the maximum rooting depth is reached
    by roots(soil and crop dependent). The extension of the root zone from the
    initial rooting depth to maximum rooting depth is described in Root_Dynamics
    class. From the moment that the maximum rooting depth is reached the soil
    profile may be described as a one layer system depending if the roots are
    able to penetrate the entire profile. If not a non-rooted part remains
    at the bottom of the profile.

    The class WaterbalanceFD is derived from WATFD.FOR in WOFOST7.1 with the
    exception that the depth of the soil is now completely determined by the
    maximum soil depth (RDMSOL) and not by the minimum of soil depth and crop
    maximum rooting depth (RDMCR).

    """Waterbalance for freely draining soils without limited production.
    This is done by setting the moisture content in root zone (SM) to the soil 
    moisture content at field capacity (SMFCF)

    The purpose of the soil water balance calculations is to estimate the
    daily value of the soil moisture content. The soil moisture content
    influences soil moisture uptake and crop transpiration.
    
    The dynamic calculations are carried out in two sections, one for the 
    calculation of rates of change per timestep (= 1 day) and one for the
    calculation of summation variables and state variables. The water balance
    is driven by rainfall, possibly buffered as surface storage, and
    evapotranspiration. The processes considered are infiltration, soil water
    retention, percolation (here conceived as downward water flow from rooted
    zone to second layer), and the loss of water beyond the maximum root zone. 

    The textural profile of the soil is conceived as homogeneous. Initially the
    soil profile consists of two layers, the actually rooted soil and the soil
    immediately below the rooted zone until the maximum rooting depth is reached
    by roots(soil and crop dependent). The extension of the root zone from the
    initial rooting depth to maximum rooting depth is described in Root_Dynamics
    class. From the moment that the maximum rooting depth is reached the soil
    profile may be described as a one layer system depending if the roots are
    able to penetrate the entire profile. If not a non-rooted part remains
    at the bottom of the profile.

    The class WaterbalanceFD is derived from WATFD.FOR in WOFOST7.1 with the
    exception that the depth of the soil is now completely determined by the
    maximum soil depth (RDMSOL) and not by the minimum of soil depth and crop
    maximum rooting depth (RDMCR).
